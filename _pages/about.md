Hey, this is my blog. I don't fully know what to put in here or how much I wish to share about me, but I've always loved blogging and such.

Here are some of the things I probably will share:

- my life
- anime/manga/books/series reviews
- makeup reviews
- cooking recipes
- my resume (probably)
- math
- code snippets
- social justice stuff

**Things I Aspire to Be/Do**

- A Mathematician
- Comparative Mythology
- Read tons of books
- Have a successful makeup blog with the related social media
- A functional adult
- A Ñoldorín liquidator in Middle-Earth Chernobyl
- Get a hold of my crippling ADHD
